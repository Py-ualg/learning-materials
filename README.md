# Learning-materials
Collection of learning materials discussed on the club meetings. At this point, the materials do not have a linear order as a python course would progress, but I am working on it.

`/classroom` contains notebooks I prepare for the meetings, with some excercises too.
`/quizzes` fodler ahs practice tasks based on the classroom notebooks, but perhaps invlove more thinking.

You can open the repository in server-hosted online environment, [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) from here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Py-ualg/learning-materials/HEAD)

List of `/classroom` notebooks:
