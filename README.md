# learning-materials
Learning materials discussed on the club meetings. At this point the materials do not have a linear structure as a python course would progress, but I am working on it.

`/classroom` contains notebooks I prepare for the meetings.
`/quizzes` have practice tasks based on the classroom notebooks.
